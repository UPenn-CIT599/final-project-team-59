and then publishes the data. The system consists of several service classes to fulfill different tasks during trading process, along with 
service listeners which are listeners to event where data is added, updated or removed to services with which they interact, and connector 
classes which flow market data into service through Service.onMessage() method or publish processed data through Connector.publish() method.
